					<br><br>
					Despite the favourable political and economic relations among the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China in the 1950s and the trade contacts with the West and the introduction of technology, China remained isolated in general. China’s economic development and diplomacy were plagued with errors especially from the 1960s onwards. For instance, emphasis was placed on “being guided by class struggle” when developing the economy, and all developed Western countries were regarded as imperialists, revisionists and anti-revolutionary, consequently the “non-conforming” struggle was waged against them. It is evident that the under 3% coverage on regulatory policies reflected our self-isolation and attempts to draw a clear line with the outside world.

					<p>In 2013, 848,500 foreigners lived in China, and the number maintained an annual growth rate of 3.9% for ten consecutive years. Immigration to China was in the spotlight and China began to emerge as an attractive immigration destination. The intensity of reform was manifested at the following three levels to ensure rational, orderly and controllable development while promoting the exploration of all-round, in-depth reforms and coordinated development. Being self-focused and fair, learning from each other and sharing information, and active participation in global governance of immigration became the focus of this period in managing foreigners in the country.

				</div>

				<div class='step' data-step='35' style='height:670px;margin-bottom: 180px;'>
					<p>Three laws on foreign investment were introduced since 1979, which offered preferential taxes and simplified the application for business permits. Foreign investment broke the deadlock and began to grow steadily, however,  concentrated primarily in China’s east-coast area and in small and medium-sized enterprises that were labour intensive and involved in manufacturing. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class='step' data-step='36' style='height:1520px;margin-bottom: 180px;'>
					<p>After China joined the WTO in 1992, foreign investment in China remained stable and continued to grow. In line with the law of fair competition, China introduced the Enterprise Income Tax Law and revoked preferential taxes for foreign investors. Foreign investors began to focus on the quality, prompting the industrial-structure upgrade, expanding to infrastructure construction and new high-tech projects. Meanwhile, systematic protection of IP came into force to protect the legal operations of foreign enterprises in China, including the introduction of the Patent Law, Regulations on the Protection of the Right to Communicate Works over Information Networks and Computers Software Protection. By the end of 2018, a total of <span>950,000</span> foreign companies invested, and the actual use of foreign investment exceeded <span>USD2.1 trillion</span>, making foreign direct investment (FDI) a pillar in China’s socioeconomic development.

				<div class='step' data-step='37' style='height:670px;margin-bottom: 700px;'>

				<div class='step' data-step='40' style='height:1100px;margin-bottom: 180px;'>
					<p>The Provisions for the Registration of Marriage between Chinese Citizens and Foreigners, ratified in 1983, were the earliest such provisions. By 2018, among the <span>10.13 million</span> registered couples across the country, 480,000 involved foreigners, overseas Chinese and residents of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.<br>
					Policies and regulations concerning foreigners’ marriage and family life in China accounted for 10.1% of the big data of media coverage over 70 years, and included marriage registration, adoption, inheritance, medical and health services, religion, entertainment, individual income-tax management and welfare and security.
					</p>

				<div class='step' data-step='41' style='height:880px;margin-bottom: 180px;'>
					<p>Development trend<br>
					1.From the management to services: On 8 Augus t 2003, the State Council promulgated the revised Regulations on Marriage Registration and successfully transitioned from marriage-registration management to service, which safeguard the legal rights and interests of marrying couples and simplified the registration process. Among the 8.11 million registered couples across the country, 78,000 involved foreigners, overseas Chinese and residents of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class='step' data-step='42' style='height:500px;margin-bottom: 180px;'>
					<p>2.Refined registration service for marriage: Since 2004, the service began keeping diversified records, including annual statistics of registration of marriage and divorce involving Chinese and foreign nationals, the age structure and distribution of registrants, changes in the ratio of marriage. They provided a more scientific and refined basis for development policies. Statistics showed marriage between Chinese and foreign nationals were changing from Chinese women marrying abroad to foreigners living and getting married in China – a rising and balancing trend. 2010 saw the solemn commemoration of the 60th anniversary marking the promulgation of the first marriage law of China. The texts for the awarding of marriage certificates were also expanded. 23 provinces developed an intra-provincial information network for marriage registration with Data Centre setting up and achieving real-time exchange at ministerial and provincial levels. In 2010, the country had a total of 2,314 marriage-registration service units, which registered 12.41 million couples, among them 49,000 involved foreigners, overseas Chinese and residents of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

					<p>Currently, the coverage of P.D on the administrative policies for the punishment of foreigners include three types of illegal activities (entry, residence, employment), illegal business operations, the Anti-Monopoly Law, illegal acquisition of citizen information (2008)(5), foreign-exchange scam, arbitrage, poaching endangered animals, piracy and rights infringement, smuggling, sale of controlled article, the management of foreign sports coaches and players (qualification verification, transfer, anti-sportsmanship and –ethic behaviour), fire safety, drug trade, scalping cultural artefacts, smuggling wild animals and endangering national security; their coverage accounted for 11.1% of the total coverage.<br>
					Ensuring equal legal treatment is also a key indicator of a country’s progressiveness, civility and openness, and no preferential treatment is given based on skin colour or nationality. Anyone who violates the law and regulations shall be treated equally without leniency. Only then will more outstanding foreign talents be drawn to work, live and study in China;
